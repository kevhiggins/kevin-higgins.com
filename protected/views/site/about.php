<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
I love problem solving. Which is also why I like to develop software. It's hard to beat telling a computer how to automate something.
Creating reusable and well thought out solutions to existing problems is very rewarding.

<div>
When I'm not programming, I like to:
<ul>
<li>Play all manners of Video/Board games</li>
<li>Participate in Taekwando</li>
<li>Hang out</li>
</ul>
